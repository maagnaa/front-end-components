    <h1>Chicken</h1>

    <p> The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated junglefowl species, with attributes of wild species
        such as the grey and the Ceylon junglefowl that are originally from Southeastern Asia.
        Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel.
        A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female
        is called a pullet.</p>

    <p> Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the
        Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries BC).
        Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets. </p>

    <p>Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as
        of 2018, up from more than 19 billion in 2011.
        There are more chickens in the world than any other bird. There are numerous cultural references to chickens –
        in myth, folklore and religion, and in language and literature.</p>

    <p>Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia, but the
        clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian subcontinent.
        From ancient India, the chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th century BC.
        Fowl have been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having
        come from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.</p>

    <h2>Terminology</h2>
    <p>An adult male is a called a cock or (in the United States) a rooster and an adult female is called a hen.</p>

    <p>Other terms are:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Biddy: a newly hatched chicken.</li>
        <li>Capon: a castrated or neutered male chicken.Chickens are omnivores.In the wild, they often scratch at the
            soilp
            to search for seeds, insects, and even animals as large as lizards, small snakes, or sometimes young mice.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>The average chicken may live for 5–10 years, depending on the breed.The world's oldest known chicken lived 16
        years according to Guinness World Records.</p>

    <p>Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking plumage of long flowing tails and shiny,
        pointed
        feathers on their necks ('hackles') and backs ('saddle'), which are typically of brighter, bolder colours than
        those
        of females of the same breed. However, in some breeds, such as the Sebright chicken, the rooster has only
        slightly
        pointed neck feathers, the same colour as the hen's. The identification can be made by looking at the comb, or
        eventually from the development of spurs on the male's legs (in a few breeds and in certain hybrids, the male
        and
        female chicks may be differentiated by colour). Adult chickens have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb,
        or
        cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin either side under their beaks called wattles. Collectively, these and other
        fleshy protuberances on the head and throat are called caruncles. Both the adult male and female have wattles
        and
        combs, but in most breeds these are more prominent in males. A 'muff' or 'beard' is a mutation found in several
        chicken breeds which causes extra feathering under the chicken's face, giving the appearance of a beard.</p>

    <p>Domestic chickens are not capable of long-distance flight, although lighter chickens are generally capable of
        flying
        for short distances, such as over fences or into trees (where they would naturally roost). Chickens may
        occasionally
        fly briefly to explore their surroundings, but generally do so only to flee perceived danger.</p>

    <p>Chicken was originally a term only for an immature, or at least young, bird. In older sources, chicken as a
        species
        were typically referred to as common fowl or domestic fowl.</p>

    <p>Chicken may also mean a chick (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands).</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Chick: a young chicken.</li>
        <li>Chook /tʃʊk/: a chicken (Australia/New Zealand, informal).</li>
        <li>Cockerel: a young male chicken less than a year old.</li>
        <li>Dunghill fowl: a chicken with mixed parentage from different domestic varieties.</li>
        <li>Pullet: a young female chicken less than a year old. In the poultry industry, a pullet is a sexually
            immature.</li>
        <li>chicken less than 22 weeks of age.</li>
        <li>Yardbird: a chicken. (southern United States, dialectal)</li>
    </ul>
